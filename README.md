# aqmonitoringeurope
Plotting the air quality monitoring sites accessible through saqgetr.

The script plot_saqgetr.R generates interactive html files that show the locations of monitoring sites split by:

 - Black Carbon  
 - Particulate Matter (PM)  
 - Heavy Metals
 - Sulphur species  
 - Ozone  
 - Nitrogen species  
 - Other  
 
 
The sites are coloured by monitor classification (urban, background, rural, industrial etc.) and clicking on a site will show a pop up with further details, such as the site opening and closing date.
